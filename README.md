# Anomaly-detection-for-vision-based-obstacle-detection-in-automated-vehicles
This repository contains the source code accompanying the Master Thesis of Siddhant Shete with the title "Anomaly detection for vision-based obstacle detection in autonomous vehicles" presented at the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering (WZL) at RWTH Aachen University.

The goal is the identification of obstacles in images using a deep hybrid anomaly detection (unsupervised learning) approach in which a deep neural network extracts high level features which are then classified using a conventional classification algorithm.
